# If setup.py or setup.cfg are newer than swift.egg-info, then tox
# will always reinstall Swift in the test virtualenv, which is really
# slow. It wouldn't be so bad if that reinstallation would update the
# timestamp on swift.egg-info, but it doesn't, so once you get an
# update to setup.py or setup.cfg, your test runs are slow forever
# after.
#
# To work around this, after a successful test run, touch
# swift.egg-info to update its mtime. This way, if there really is a
# change to setup.py/setup.cfg, then one (slow) reinstall will occur,
# and then subsequent test runs will use the existing one.
